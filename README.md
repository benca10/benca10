### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Bence

I'm an aspiring data professional with a background in the humanities and a growing passion for data analysis and technology. I'm currently learning tools like Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python to better understand how data can support smarter decisions and improve processes.

Here on GitHub, I share small projects, learning exercises, and experiments as I build my skills and confidence step by step. I'm especially interested in data visualization, reporting, and how structured data can support real-world outcomes.

Always open to feedback, collaboration, and learning from others â€” thanks for stopping by!
